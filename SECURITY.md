# Security Policy

## Support & Updates

This is a small hobby project. Security updates are **best‑effort** and may be infrequent.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open an issue and include the word **SECURITY** in the title. Avoid posting sensitive proof‑of‑concept details publicly; keep reports minimal.
If needed, you can ask a maintainer for a direct contact channel in that issue.

## Dangerous Behavior Disclaimer

This app can **permanently delete files** (in **Move** mode). Double‑check folder paths and test with disposable data first. **Use at your own risk.**
The maintainers are **not responsible** for any data loss or damage.
